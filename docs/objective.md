# 🧠 Objective (Reframed with Quantum Agents)

Design and deploy a **quantum-enhanced agent** that autonomously explores, evaluates, and evolves cisplatin analogs for effective pancreatic cancer treatment. The agent integrates quantum chemistry simulations, QNN-based prediction models, and quantum optimization strategies to discover analogs with high efficacy, resistance evasion, and biological viability.

## 🧪 Part 1: Biological Target and Agent Goal

### 🎯 Agent's Challenge Environment:
The agent operates under the constraints of pancreatic tumors, which present:

- Dense stromal barriers preventing drug diffusion  
- Hypoxic, acidic microenvironments altering drug chemistry  
- Multi-layered resistance mechanisms, including:  
  - Overexpression of efflux pumps  
  - Detoxification via GSTP1  
  - Enhanced DNA repair  

### 🧬 Target Structures:
The agent’s optimization efforts are directed toward analogs that disrupt or exploit:

- Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA binding regions (G-rich segments)  
- Mutant KRAS signaling pathways  
- GSTP1 enzyme interaction sites (to avoid resistance)

## ⚛️ Part 2: Quantum Chemistry Module (Agent's Simulation Brain)

### 🔧 Step 1: Analog Generation
The agent uses embedded chemoinformatics tools (e.g., **RDKit**, **Avogadro**) to:

- Mutate ligands (e.g., ammine → aryl/alkyl groups)  
- Alter oxidation states (e.g., Pt(IV) prodrugs)  
- Adjust hydrophobicity and steric profile  
- Build and manage a search space of 50–200 analogs  

### ⚙️ Step 2: Molecular Simulation Engine (VQE)

For each candidate, the agent computes:

- Ground-state electronic energy  
- HOMO–LUMO gap (reactivity profile)  
- Electrostatic potential maps  
- Dipole moments  
- Ligand exchange energetics  

**Simulations run via:**

- PySCF, Gaussian, or ORCA for baseline  
- PennyLane VQE module for quantum-enhanced insight  

**Basis sets:**  
6-31G(d,p), LANL2DZ for Pt atoms

## 🧠 Part 3: QNN-Based Evaluation Module

### 🧩 Step 3: Molecular Representation for QNN
Each analog is encoded into a quantum-accessible feature vector, including:

- VQE-derived quantum descriptors  
- Classical fingerprints (e.g., Morgan, topological, graph-based)  
- Docking scores (classical or quantum-enhanced)  
- Resistance markers (e.g., predicted GSTP1 affinity)  
- Toxophore and ADMET flags  

**Feature encoding into qubits uses:**

- Angle encoding: `RY(x)`  
- Amplitude encoding (optional for future QML scale-up)  

```python
for i in range(n_features):
    qml.RY(features[i], wires=i)
